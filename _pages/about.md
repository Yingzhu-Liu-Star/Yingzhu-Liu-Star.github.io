### About Me
I'm a third-year Ph.D. Candidate in Dynamical Systems and Control with the Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science at the College of Engineering, Peking University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhongkui Li](https://www.zhongkuili-pku.com/cn/). I also work closely with [Prof. Pengcheng You](https://pengcheng-you.github.io/desires-lab/people.html), who leads [DESIRES Lab](https://pengcheng-you.github.io/desires-lab/) at the College of Engineering, Peking University. Prior to that, I acquired my Bachelor's degree majoring in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, at the College of Engineering, Peking University.  You can find my CV [here](https://yingzhu-liu-star.github.io/assets/img/publication_preview/Academic_CV.pdf).

### Research Interests
My current research interests include saddle flow dynamics, optimization, control theory and reinforcement learning.
