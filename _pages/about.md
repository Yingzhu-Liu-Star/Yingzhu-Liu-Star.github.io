### About Me
I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Dynamical Systems and Control with the Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science at the College of Engineering, Peking University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhongkui Li](https://www.zhongkuili-pku.com/cn/). I also work closely with [Prof. Pengcheng You](https://pengcheng-you.github.io/desires-lab/people.html), who leads [DESIRES Lab](https://pengcheng-you.github.io/desires-lab/) at the College of Engineering, Peking University. Prior to that, I acquired my Bachelor's degree majoring in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, at the College of Engineering, Peking University.  

Currently, I am a visiting scholar at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, working with [Prof. Ashish Cherukuri](https://ashish-rug.github.io/).

You can find my CV [here](https://yingzhu-liu-star.github.io/assets/img/publication_preview/Academic_CV.pdf).

### Research Interests
My current research interests include saddle flow dynamics, optimization, control theory, and reinforcement learning. In particular, my work focuses on developing unified frameworks and deeper insights for the design and analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems and discrete-time algorithms.

Additionally, I am interested in risk-aware optimization, with a particular focus on decentralized distributionally robust algorithms. 

Feel free to contact me for any discussions and potential collaborations.
